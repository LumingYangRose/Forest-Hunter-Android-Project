Forest Hunter is a 2D side-scrolling game developed and published by NEU CS5520 Forest Hunter Team. The game enables its players to role-play as a hunter living in a wild forest and trying to survive by hunting down wild animals and escaping from beast chase-down.

At the beginning of the game, players will be able to choose the appearance of the character. In this game, players can use simple operations such as swipe, quick taps and press and release to control the hunter character in the game. The player will face some challenges in the game as the character needs to avoid running into large obstacles or falling down the cliff, otherwise the beast will get a chance to catch the hunter. During the escape, the hunter will be able to throw his javelin and hunt down birds or other prey and distract the beast.
